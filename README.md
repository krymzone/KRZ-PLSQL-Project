Project created for my Database Coure

# Employee Attendance Tracking

This employee attendance tracking database was created in order to make managing
a large array of employees easier, it can track many important managerial variables like
attendance, leaves and leave requests, and even worker shifts if needed. In order to
achieve all of that, the original schema from both the first and second semester had to
be modified by adding a few more tables, here is the modified database schema ( Note
that it there are more tables, adding more functionality to the database itself, but I
chose to show only the ones relevant to my project ).
